   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Coreque's documentation
=======================

A simple way to claim pull request *code reviews* as your own, and automate the
inefficiency of finding relevant pull requests to review by sifting out
projects you're not interested in, as well as taking responsibility / assigning
a review to yourself.

**Source code**: `Github`_

.. note:: We're currently in planning stages right now. We'll keep this up to
    date as things solidify. For the most up-to-date docs, check the
    `README`_ file.
